#  Café Billing System - Final Year Project
The Café Billing System is a web-based application developed to improve the efficiency of order management and billing operations in a café. The traditional billing system involves manual calculations, handwritten receipts, and a high probability of human error. This project aims to replace the conventional system with an automated billing solution that enhances speed, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. The system allows customers to place orders, calculates the bill automatically, applies applicable taxes such as 5% GST, and generates a digital receipt. Additionally, the system provides an admin panel for café owners to manage menu items, track orders, and generate sales reports.
This project is designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript making it a robust and scalable solution. With an intuitive user interface, the system ensures that both café staff and customers have a seamless experience.
